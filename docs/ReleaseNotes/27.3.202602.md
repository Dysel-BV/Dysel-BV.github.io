| 66990 | General | For the document distribution reports now a filter is available to filter on only documents for a certain document distribution code. Dealer Document Distribution code setups and assignments will need to be reviewed for customers in ELC to make sure the correct information has been assigned.  |
| 67905 | General | Prevented the error "nothing to reverse" if there is a Sales Shipment Line with a quantity of zero |
| 67979 | General | Created a report extension and widened the Item column |
| 67997 | General | Updated some object numberings which did lead to breaking changes and updated some option fields to the new Enum option. |
| 67174 | Equipment | Enabled the possibility to transfer equipment object with posting status **Stock** to posting status **Used** and vice versa. This is now also enabled for posting status **Rental**. |
| 67808 | Equipment | Changed warranty message on Work Order (Quotes). When no warranty data is set no message is shown; When 1 or more warranty conditions is met then a message is shown (in red) "Out of Warranty:" including all the fields that triggerd this message; When a equipment object is in warranty then the message "In Warranty" is shown |
| 67925 | Equipment | Fixed a problem with reversing depreciated objects. We added a *mandatory* depreciation journal batch field to the **Finance** fast tab of the Dysel Setup that will be used in depreciation posting as part of other processes like sales invoicing and crediting. We recommend setting up a dedicated journal batch with a number series. |
| 67930 | Equipment | Made sure that the depreciable basis on the depreciation setup is based on the bookvalue of the object. |
| 67963 | Equipment | Solved an issue with finding Equipment Object Entries to see if an action can be reversed. |
| 68059 | Equipment | Added equipment data to gl/ entry for payment method account when an internal work order is invoiced. |
| 68099 | Equipment | Resolved an issue that occurred when converting a sales quote into a sales order with equipment lines, where archiving the quote did not correctly copy the line configurators to the archived document. |
| 66611 | Service | You can now correct a customer work order sales invoice that includes consumed objects. The consumption will be reversed and the line object will be placed on Stock. Internal invoices for things like enhancements will remain blocked for reversal. |
| 67910 | Rental | Previously, when there were no Rental Lines (with Status = Delivered) on an Equipment object and the Service Type (with Sell-to Customer = 'From last Rental Customer') was specified on the Work Order, the system displayed an error stating that the Bill-to Customer must not be empty. This error is no longer raised. When no Rental Contract Lines are found, ELC no longer validates the Customer No. with an empty value and instead continues with the default validations. |
| 67988 | Rental | Fixed issue where the General Product Posting Group was not taken from the Equipment Product Posting Group when inserting an object in a rental contract line. |
| 67743 | Integration | Toyota Fleet Invoice: The maximum field length for the Repair Description is 30 characters. In case it exceeds the 30 characters, the entire service description is added to the Text Line section. The extended text from the Service Description and from the Work Order Reporting Lines RP1 till RP3 are also written to the text line section. The maximum length for a text line is 132 characters. |
| 67989 | Integration | When the feature for the extended text is not enabled, the system returns the error message that the page contains a control add-in that is no longer present in BC 27.2. We have replaced the add-in with its replacement. Do keep in mind that this method of storing extended text will be phased out and that we recommend using the new extended text feature in Dysel Feature Management. |
| 64845 | Credit Management | Moved the "PickUp/Ship" question on Release Sales Order. |
| 67940 | Mobile Field Service | Added Placeholder Model functionality for the app. |
| 67984 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed issue with mobile client type. |
| 68030 | Mobile Field Service | Work Order History pages now show Extended Text on Reporting Lines correctly. |
| 68070 | Mobile Field Service | The Dysel Mobile app is now available in the Google Play Store for Android devices and the App Store for iOS devices. |
| 68159 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed bug with attachments. |
