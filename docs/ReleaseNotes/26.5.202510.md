| Case No. | Module | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 64458 | General | Issue reported with changing the Ship-To type has been resolved. Fixed a bug that was preventing the user from setting a custom ship-to address in the sales order. Ship To types can now be changed between Default (Sell To Address), Alternate Shipping Address and Custom Address. Customer Address information can be modified as needed from the sales order. |
| 66821 | General | Refactored address formatting on reports to allow for longer address and name values. |
| 67017 | General | Added Created by Name as a flowfield to Transfer Receipt Header, Transfer Shipment Header and Direct Transfer Header table and pages. |
| 67172 | General | Document distribution batch reports will no longer stop processing when they encounter issues. Events have been added to enable error detection customization in BC and on Power Platform. |
| 67173 | General | Added the option to include or exclude the company name, both in the default setting and in language-specific email subject lines for document distribution. If the Include Company Name is selected, the subject will be prepended by the company name as set up in Company Information. |
| 67179 | General | Renamed "Take Price Structure From" on the customer card to "Price Structure Source" to bring it more in line with naming convention and fixed a bug where it did not always apply the correct price structure to the work order line. |
| 66530 | Equipment | Overhauled equipment object wizard. Refreshed the UI to tidy it up and make it more logical and user-friendly. Made the opening of the object card at the end optional and streamlined the cancellation process. Also fixed a bug that occasionally occurred when a template was applied to the wizard. |
| 67359 | Equipment | Posting object depreciation with negative amounts is now possible on the equipment journal. In addition, users can now post depreciation on the equipment journal line without a cost type, provided that the account no. and balance account no. fields are both filled. |
| 67360 | Equipment | Clicking the Documents button will no longer update the documents in question, but just show the documents related to the equipment object. |
| 66638 | Parts | Item Price Journal - In case the Catalogue Entry contains an Item No. and the Item No. does not exist anymore, the Item - No. on the Item Price Journal remains empty. When executing the function Create/Update Catalogue, the Item No. on the Catalogue Card will be emptied. |
| 66857 | Parts | When creating a new Catalogue Item from a Sales Quote, made sure no further messages are received regarding wrong primary key. |
| 67253 | Parts | Apply pay-to vendor currency code to requisition line so that resulting purchase orders are generated using the correct pay-to currency. |
| 67302 | Parts | Replaced the Error ToDo by getting the Work Order Usage when calculating the Fill Rate. |
| 67015 | Finance | On the Doc Distr S-Invoice/S-Pre Payment page, it is now possible to select in which order the documents must be generated. Available options are: No., Bill-to Customer No., Sell-to Customer No. and Salesperson Code. |
| 67161 | Finance |  In the Dysel NA app, added the option Sorting on No or Name so that the user can choose in which order the NA Customer Statements must be printed. |
| 66471 | Service | Added fields Manufacturer Code, Equipment Model, and Serial No. to the output of report 11021752 - Work Order List to Excel with WIP. These fields will be included if the Show Object Details setting on the request page is ticked. |
| 67051 | Service | Fixed the issue when the work type code in the work order line that came from the timesheet had the wrong value. |
| 67052 | Service | Environments with Work Order Shipment Functionality enabled create and post Sales Shipments for Items when usage is posted. When the Service Type of a work order is changed, the Posted Sales Shipment was not reversed to allow for the Gen Bus Posting Group/Gen Prod Posting Group information to change when the Service Type shows a different Invoicing Method (Internal, External) for the new Service Type versus what was originally assigned. Changes have been made to allow for the Posted Sales Shipment to be reversed if the Service Type is changed in the General Tab, and the Dysel Setup is to update all lines with the Service Type change in the header. If the Service Type is changed on a line by a user instead of in the header, users must use the Unpost function for each line that is to have the service type changed.  |
| 67178 | Service | Fixed bug when the Equipment Object validation in a Work Order caused an error if the record was not inserted at that point. Work orders can be opened successfully if an Equipment Object is added to the work order prior to any other details if the object matches any default setups in ELC.  |
| 67190 | Service | Made some performance enhancements to timesheet posting and unposting. |
| 67254 | Service | Posting or unposting of a timesheet line for a work order is now only possible when the status of the work order is open. The unposting of timesheet lines is also possible for environments with the Work Order Shipment Functionality enabled. |
| 67285 | Service | Unposting of timesheet lines was not working as expected. The issue with doubling of quantities has been resolved. Timesheet lines can only be unposted if the work order is in open WIP and has an open status. For environments with and without the Work Order Shipment Functionality active the following will happen: If the Dysel Setup for Post Usage from Timeline is set to true, timesheet lines that are unposted from the timesheet but showed a quantity used on the work order will remain on the work order with all quantities removed when the unposting from the timesheet is complete. When the timesheet line is posted a second time, a new line will be created showing the Quantity and Quantity Used based on the timesheet. If the Dysel Setup for Post Usage from Timeline is set to false, timesheet lines that are unposted from the timesheet but showed no quantity used on the work order will be removed from the work order when the unposting from the timesheet is complete. |
| 67378 | Service | Enhanced performance of work order line updates to help reduce lock timeouts. |
| 63356 | Rental | Changed the setup and way of creating a Waiver line for rental contracts. When a Rental Rate has the Check Insurance Expiry Date set to True, the check for insurance is done on the Sell To Customer used in the Rental Contract to verify if the Insurance Reason Code is filled and checks the Insurance Certificate Exp Date. If a waiver percentage or amount is filled on the Rental Rate Line, a waiver line will be added to the Rental Contract invoice Detail Lines. Entering a specific customer on a Rental Rate card is no longer necessary.  |
| 66480 | Rental | Rental contract lines are now kept in the correct number sequence when cross selling lines are used and contract lines are assigned for the second time. |
| 67115 | Rental | Added functionality that will copy the rental rate from a rental quote to a rental contract and will add the rental contract no. and line number to the rental rate. The created rental rate no. will be inserted in the rental contract line. |
| 67141 | Rental | Resolved issue with Rental Contract Quote line discounts. Calculations are now as expected based on the Line Discount % added to the line and the Line Discount Amount populates with the correct discount amount. In the case where a double discount was added, this has also been resolved. If a Rental Quote Line has a line discount this is calculated in the Rental Contract Invoice Detail Lines. The amount of the quote line should now be equal to the detail line(s). |
| 65772 | Purchase | Added equipment model as a hidden field to purchase line pages. This field can be added through personalization. Also replaced the BC Type and No. fields with their Dysel counterparts so that Dysel line types such as Object and Charge can be more readily identified. |
| 67037 | Integration | In the Dysel D2V app, the actions Import from Flat File and Catalogue Import Profiles are added to the Catalogue and Catalogue List. In the Dysel D2V - Toyota app, the action Import Toyota Substitutions is added to the Catalogue and Catalogue List. With the Import Toyota Substitutions the FORKSUB.txt file can be imported into the Catalogue. The import functionality contains hardcoded positions, namely position 2, 15 characters long for the old number, position 17, 15 characters long for the new number and position 32, 1 character contains information about removing or creating the substitution. |
| 67038 | Integration | Do not ask the question in case the Vendor Item No. on the Item Card is empty and the Catalogue Entry for this Item contains a Vendor Item No. when importing a price file. |
| 67196 | Localization | Resolved performance and locking issue in sales tax data validation in enhancement purchase posting for North-American localization. |
| 67361 | Graphical Dispatch Board | Updated graphical add-in to latest version. |
| 66470 | Mobile Field Service | When updating mobile code, job queues will now be halted temporarily in order to preserve data integrity. |
| 66897 | Mobile Field Service | Added fixes for performance enhancement in mobile data processing. |
| 67026 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed an issue where attempting to sign-off in Mobile Field Service could result in a Nil value error if required data was missing or not properly initialized. The sign-off process now includes validation to ensure all necessary fields are populated, preventing the error and allowing successful completion. |
| 67181 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed issue with BC-added timesheet lines combined with automatic time tracking in the app |
| 67300 | Mobile Field Service | Implemented measures to minimize locking behavior when inserting or modifying a work order line when Dysel Mobile is installed in the system. |
| 67315 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed issue with empty Sell-to Customer and Review functionality |
| 67333 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed issue where Meter Reading had to be filled in again on final check |
| 67345 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed problem with duplicate Extended Text if they are created on the same second by different users |
| 67351 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed multiple Measurement problems |
| 65142 | Transport | Added option to release and reopen a transport order to facilitate clearer distinction between open and ready to plan orders. We also added external business events and APIs to allow the use of Power Automate to further automate process flows. Finally, we added the option to add additional lines to an existing non-released sales transport order retroactively. |
| 67021 | Transport | Fixed the issue when a user tried to print a report from a transport order and the output was directly saved as PDF. The user will now get the request page of the report so the user can decide what to do (print, save as, etc). |
| 67310 | Transport | Added the functionality to combine multiple rental contract lines on one transport order. |
| 66517 | Other | Prepayment fast tab on sales quote card now shows the correct title. |
| 67330 | Other | Added performance enhancements for the new extended text feature that will become standard as of 27.0.202511 |
