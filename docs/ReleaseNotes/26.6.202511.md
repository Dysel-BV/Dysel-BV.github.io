| Case No. | Module | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 67458 | General | Postponed general availability of new extended text feature to May 2026 to better ensure a smooth transition. It is recommended that you turn this feature on in your test and copy of production environments. If successful, you can elect to apply this change to Production. |
| 67372 | Equipment | Enabled functionality to post a rerent object via a purchase order or purchase invoice without being connected to a rental contract. |
| 67376 | Equipment | The object status should no longer update when invoicing a work order on a consolidated invoice. |
| 67408 | Equipment | Fixed error that was caused by incorrect equipment value entry sorting when looking for existing equipment value entries when creating a corrective sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice. |
| 67503 | Equipment | Field Asset No. is added on the equipment object card which can be used for Intercompany purposes. |
| 67597 | Equipment | Fixed incorrect reversal of depreciated object when the depreciation account interim is not inserted in Dysel setup and when a negative line is inserted via an equipment journal. |
| 67410 | Parts | Fixed the issue causing the unit price not to be calculated correctly for customers with a currency code and using sales price calculation. |
| 67545 | Parts | Resolved incorrect calculation of unit price when there was no sales price calculation available and only sales prices in combination with different currency. |
| 67404 | Finance | Created a new report Adjust Cost - Item Entries ELC which does not stop in case there is an error message but it prints the line with the latest error message. If the report does not print any Item, it means that it ran successful. With the Inventory Cost Adjustment it is also possible to run the Adjust Cost - Item Entries for all items or for a selection. |
| 67209 | Service | Added a warning when closing a released work order where no posted sales invoice or posted credit memo is created. |
| 67394 | Service | Fixed issue in NA extension that caused taxes to calculate incorrect. The tax liable setup on customer cards was not being recognized correctly in work order. There was also an issue with how taxes for Shop Service jobs were being calculated. System now recognizes the Tax Liable setup and now pulls the correct tax area code for calculating taxes for Shop Service work orders.  |
| 67412 | Service | Prevent adding quotes (sales, rental, maintenance and work order) to consolidated orders. When a quote is created for a customer with a consolidated order for the specific document type being created, no prompt is received to add the document to the consolidated order. |
| 67428 | Service | Fixed bug that was causing to get the customer price groups from the bill-to customer instead of the sell-to customer when the work order is created for an equipment object that is in a maintenance contract. |
| 67452 | Service | Fixed problem that the General Business Posting Group was not updated when we change the service type from external (with external service type setup) to external (with internal service type setup).  When the service type is changed to show a different service type with a different Default Invoicing Method, postings will be reversed and Gen Bus Posting Groups updated on shipments if the work order shipment functionality has been enabled. Service types can be changed in the header with reversals and unpostings happening automatically. If individual lines need to show a different service type and different Default Invoicing Method, the Unpost Usage function in the lines will need to be used. If the shipment functionality is not enabled, there will be no change in process for how service types are changed on work order headers or lines.  |
| 67469 | Service | Fixed issue with the Work Type Code in the lines of a Work Order not updating correctly based on setups and changes made either in the timesheet, work order general tab and/or the work order lines.  |
| 62263 | Purchase | Enabled the functionality to delete a purchase order that is connected to a work order if the purchase order is completely received and invoiced no matter the posting status of the work order. |

| 67167 | Localization | Added an item fill rate and turnover report for the North-American localization. Report "Item Fill Rate/Turnover NA ELC" (11335993) will calculate item fill rate and turnover and export an Excel workbook with the results. |
