| 64081 | Equipment | A new field has been added to the Dysel setup titled **Apply Service Actions on Creation**. This setup will be checked when creating objects from the Equipment Object Wizard, from a Purchase Order and/or from Equipment Dispatch to either add or not add service actions to a new object. |
| 67338 | Equipment | Set the Rental Status field in Equipment Object to obsolete, including all references to this field. |

With the changes for Usage, Release, and Invoicing, time sheet postings were impacted. Changes were made to the new User Setups to allow time sheet lines to be posted when Work Order Usage Permission = Disallow. With the disallow setup, time sheet lines will show as posted and work order resource lines will show as used if the Post Usage From Timeline in Dysel Setup is set to true. |
