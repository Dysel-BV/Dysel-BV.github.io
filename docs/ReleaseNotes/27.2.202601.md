| Case No. | Module | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 67222 | General | Removed obsolete references to old Transport functionality from the UI. When searching for Transport Orders, only Transport Order List is returned as an option.  |
| 67769 | General | Posted Sales Credit Memos could not be emailed. This has been resolved and emailing of posted sales credit memos is available.  |
| 67775 | General | Maintenance contracts will now show and open on the consolidated order Documents view. |
| 67864 | General | Introduced flexible output options on document distribution that will allow users to run prints in batch and store the PDFs as a zip file that can be downloaded after or moved forward through Power Platform integration. This will allow batch creation of PDFs through document distribution. Retention policies have been made available to set up automated data cleanup to prevent excessive database growth. |
| 67946 | General | Added the tax label in report 92802. |
| 67588 | Equipment | Fixed the issue that when creating the object depreciation setup from template was stating that a record already was present which was not the case. |
| 67677 | Equipment | Fixed issue that unposting a sales shipment for an object was causing an incorrect value in the statistics due to incorrect equipment value entries. Also made sure that the account and balancing account numbers used in this process in the equipment value entries match the account numbers used in the g/l entries. |
| 67789 | Equipment | Made sure that the check for separate receipt and invoice is done at another place in the code to avoid errors when started out of a purchase invoice. |
| 67800 | Equipment | Vendor Position No. added to Equipment Object Card (via Personalize you can add the field in editable mode) |
| 67818 | Equipment | In a very specific scenario for sales order with prepayment an error about G/L entries did pop up. This one is solved right now. |
| 67829 | Equipment | Fixed issue where the posting of a sales shipment for an object line added the Inventory Account and COGS Account to the COGS equipment value entry instead of the Inventory Account (Interim) and COGS Account (Interim). |
| 67835 | Equipment | From a claim, the equipment object assigned could not be viewed. Created a LookUp in the Equipment Object field that will return a list of objects assigned to the customer on the claim and added Equipment Object to Navigate in the Action bar. Using this action will return the equipment object page for viewing. From the Equipment Object field, only objects assigned to the customer on the claim will be returned. |
| 67843 | Equipment | Fixed issue that caused the usage of incorrect G/L Account for COGS postings when posting the invoice when object had depreciation equipment value entries. |
| 67873 | Equipment | Made change in report Update Ordered Units to make sure the confirmation (to change the serial number on a purchase line) is not given when the report is run in the job queue. |
| 67877 | Equipment | Location information for consumed equipment objects now automatically updates when the parent equipment object's location changes through sales, rental transactions, or transfers. This enhancement ensures accurate tracking of equipment components and their physical locations throughout the system. |
| 67880 | Equipment | Fixed the issue that caused the depreciation amount to be calculated incorrectly. |
| 67828 | Parts | When Delete all lines in worksheet is used on the requisition worksheet all reservation entries for that worksheet are deleted. |
| 67872 | Parts | If there was a ' character in the middle of an item the report for adjust cost could run into an error. Changed this filter. |
| 67402 | Finance | Added Dysel BC source codes to the source code setup and centralized source code retrieval to help provide a better audit trail. |
| 67431 | Finance | Improved performance and simplified presentation of the General Ledger Entries page. Hid several non-essential fields by default. If needed, these can be re-added using personalization. Also enhanced the tooltips on the fields and the "Export Selected Lines to Excel" action. |
| 63958 | Service | Added to Service Visit table the flowfield starting date of the Resource Allocation; Added to dataset on report 11021693: ResourceStartDate XML's for the report layout do show the new field. If when working in custom layouts using existing layouts and xml errors/warnings are given, a new custom layout may need to be created to bring in the changes and correct the errors. |
| 67280 | Service | Streamlined the retrieval of the last rental customer for work orders. The last rental sell-to customer is now consistently defined as the sell-to customer on the last rental line (ordered by starting date/time) with status **Delivered**. The same process applies to the last rental bill-to customer where applicable. |
| 67803 | Service | Ship-to Name 2 on work order will now be updated correctly. |
| 67823 | Service | Issue was reported where customers that are marked as internal were being charged taxes even if the tax liable was set to false. This was seen mostly with service types that included both internal and external invoicing for the work orders lines. The issue has been resolved. If an internal customer is marked as tax liable equals false, this setup follows the work order lines all the way to invoicing.  |
| 67859 | Service | When a time sheet line is posted by a user which does not have rights to post work order usage but the setup is to post work order usage when time sheet line is posted now the usage posting in this indirect scenario for the user is possible. |
