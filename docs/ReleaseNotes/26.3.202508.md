# Dysel BC 26.3.202508

| Case No. | Module | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 66165 | General | Updated the internal address formatting to conform to the updated Microsoft standard. |
| 66653 | General | Fixed bug in orphaned user overruled record deletion in Data Administration that could in some cases give an error if a parent record no longer existed. The deletion process should now continue on without throwing that exception. |
| 66749 | General | Fixed a bug where the sales order archive was not displaying Dysel BC line types correctly. Line types like Object and Charge should now reflect the correct values. |
| 66785 | General | Added fleet code as a selectable field in the layout dataset in the North-American Equipment Order Confirmation report (11335976) in the NA localization. |
| 66834 | General | Fixed a bug where a work order attached to a consolidated order with timesheet lines posted with time rounding would not be closed on invoice. When invoicing the consolidated order, these work orders should now close as expected. |
| 66310 | Equipment | Get the correct G/L Accounts from the Inventory Posting Setup when posting an Enhancement or Adjustment via the Equipment Journal for Objects with Posting Status Rental or Used.  <br><br/>In addition, we introduced several extra checks to ensure that posting accounts are filled in the equipment posting setup and inventory setup. |
| 66577 | Equipment | Performance changes for the object rental list. |
| 66750 | Equipment | Fixed a bug where the object current location for trade-ins on sales order was not updated correctly on posting. When posting shipment for a trade-in object on the sales order, the object location should now update to the location code on the sales order line correctly. |
| 66851 | Equipment | Fixed an issue where, when converting a model line to an object through the equipment dispatch, the branch and department from a sales order were not copied correctly to the object or subsequent purchase and work orders. The branch and department should now populate the object and purchase/work order documents correctly. Keep in mind that these values will override any branch or department settings on the user setup. |
| 65239 | Parts | Added an action to view stockkeeping units (SKUs) per location on the location list and card. In addtion, we introduced SKU templates where you can set up default configurations for, e.g. a van and then apply that to a location. That way, you can more easily set up locations that have similar SKUs. |
| 66737 | Parts | Fixed bug in catalogue import update dialog. The dialog window showed the (occasionally blank) item no. from the Item Price Journal, making for a confusing message. The update dialog now correctly shows the Catalogue No. value. |
| 66407 | Finance | Fixed an issue where a corrective credit memo could not be posted due to the posting date ranges set on users. The corrective credit memo will now post with the work date as the posting and document date. This date change will not have an impact on pricing or discounts as this would cause issues with the credit process. |
| 66659 | Finance | Fixed filter on equipment value entries in Find Entries... action on the posted sales invoice. The equipment value entries are now correctly filtered on the document no. of the posted sales invoice. |
| 66748 | Finance | Fixed a bug in sales invoice generation for resell contracts from the financing card. Resell contracts should now generate a sales invoice when given the correct invoicing date. |
| 63045 | Service | The initial value for the ELC Doc. Type field on work orders will now be set to "Work Order" to allow for better differentiation with consolidated work orders. The Consolidated Order field on the work order is now non-editable. New actions have been added to Attach and Detach the work order from the Consolidated Order directly from the work order. Documentation has been created for how to use the new Attach/Detach functionality. |
| 64477 | Service | Updated report for service visit to allow the exclusion of resource and resource group lines being printed. If the resource lines are excluded from the print, summaries for resource amount, amount incl. tax, and amount (LCY) will be available to place on the layout. |
| 64969 | Service | Fixed a bug where the work order usage account was retrieved incorrectly when the owning location of the equipment object differed from the location code on the work order line. The account is now correctly based on the object owning location. |
| 65986 | Service | Fixed a bug in work order line creation for service action. If there is an agreed price on the service action, it will now be applied to the work order line and marked as overruled, preventing inadvertent changes by other processes. |
| 66139 | Service | Fixed bug in the NA localization that could cause a "divide by zero" error in sales tax calculation when invoicing a work order where usage for a single line had been posted multiple times with with an increasing quantity. The invoice should now be generated as normal with the correct tax amount. |
| 66709 | Service | Added a check to prevent the resource allocation to be deleted when there is an open service visit attached. |
| 66729 | Purchase | Fixed bug where the equipment product posting setup values were not applied to the purchase line for trade-in objects. An equipment product posting setup for Purchase/Trade-in should now apply its values to object purchase lines of the trade-in statistics type. |
| 64287 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed Bill-to Customer being filled in on Work Orders |
| 66702 | Mobile Field Service | Meter Reading now allowing the same value when it's deliberately filled in |
| 66703 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed Time Sheet Sorting on Start Date/Time |
| 66826 | Mobile Field Service | user is forced to finish creating SV upon creation in the app |
| 66836 | Mobile Field Service | Fixed Automatic Time Tracking when the user has an empty Service Visit list |
| 66436 | Other | Added overload to new extended text feature that allows a text to be passed directly instead of through an stream. This should improve external integration with this new functionality.  <br><br/>New extended text is a feature in Dysel feature management that will become standard by November 2025. |
