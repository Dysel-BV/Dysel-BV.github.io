# Dysel Features

Dysel feature management lets you control when new or changed functionality becomes available in your Dysel BC environment. It provides a central overview of all features that can be switched on or off, so you can:

- Pilot new capabilities with a limited group of users.
- Gradually roll out functionality across companies or locations.
- Keep upcoming changes disabled until your organization is ready.

Each feature has a clear name and description, and can be enabled or disabled per environment from a single overview page in Dysel BC. This helps administrators coordinate testing, training, and communication, while ensuring that changes are applied in a controlled and predictable way.

## Preparing for Mandatory Features
Feature management also tracks from which version a feature is available and whether it will be automatically enabled in future releases. This allows you to prepare in advance for changes that will become mandatory over time.

> #### The automatic activation is an indication and might be subject to delay in case more care is needed before the feature is considered market-ready.

We highly recommend testing features in your test environment well *before* they are set to become mandatory. That way, you can ensure that you gain experience with the new feature and can pre-empt unforeseen issues.
