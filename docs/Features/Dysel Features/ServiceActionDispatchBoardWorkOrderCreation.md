# Service Action Dispatch Board Work Order Creation

The **Service Action Dispatch Board Work Order Creation** feature adds a wizard-based flow for creating work orders directly from the service action dispatch board. This gives dispatchers more control when converting actions into work orders.

## Overview

From the service action dispatch board, you typically plan and assign service actions to resources. With this feature enabled, you can:

- Start a guided wizard from a service action.
- Review and adjust key information before the work order is created.
- Create work orders with improved defaults and options compared to a simple one-step creation.

## How it helps

This feature is designed for dispatchers and planners who:

- Need to create work orders quickly from the dispatch board.
- Still want the flexibility to review branches, departments, customers, equipment, or other key data before confirming the work order.
- Want to reduce the number of corrections needed after a work order has been created.

The wizard helps standardize how work orders are created from service actions, which leads to more consistent data and fewer errors.

## Availability and enablement

- **Available from:** May 2026 (version 28.0.202605).
- The feature can be enabled from the Dysel feature management page.
- Once enabled, dispatchers will see the enhanced wizard when creating work orders from the service action dispatch board.
