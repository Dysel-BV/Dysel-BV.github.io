# Rental Credit

The **Rental Credit** feature lets you credit rental invoices using a corrective credit memo that is linked directly to the original sales invoice. This ensures that corrections for rental charges are handled accurately and traceably.

## Overview

In rental scenarios, you may need to correct invoiced amounts because of pricing changes, incorrect periods, or other adjustments. With Rental Credit enabled, Dysel BC supports:

- Creating corrective credit memos directly from the original rental-related sales invoice.
- Keeping a clear link between the original document and the correction.
- Ensuring that rental and financial data stay aligned.
- More control over your rental credit process

## How it helps

This feature helps you:

- Reduce manual work when correcting rental invoices.
- Allows easy crediting of any period and multiple periods
- Improve auditability by keeping a clear connection between the invoice and the credit.
- Avoid inconsistent corrections across rental and sales processes.

Users work from the existing sales invoice and create a corrective credit memo, so they do not need to rebuild rental information from scratch.

## Availability and enablement

- **Available from:** May 2026 (version 28.0.202605).
- The feature can be enabled from the Dysel feature management page.
- Once enabled, new rental corrections should be handled using the corrective credit memo flow.
