# Contribute
The Dysel Learn portal is something that we have created to help you help yourself. But we also see this portal as a collaborative effort in which you can help us help you. If you are missing information on this portal, or think that existing information can be more extensive, we invite you to submit a correction or even a new page.

## How to contribute
If you want to help create documentation, you can navigate to the [Dysel Documentation Repository](https://github.com/Dysel-BV/Dysel-BV.github.io). 

There, you can create an issue and, if you want, create a pull request with the changes you like. In order to do so, you will need to have an account on GitHub. See [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) on how to create a free account.

### The contrbution process
The documentation is created in MarkDown: a simple and straightforward markup language. For more information on MarkDown, you can check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) You can also use existing content for examples.
In order to maintain consistency in our documentation, we have instituted a layred process:
1. Create an issue (either for a correction or for new documentation) and describe what you would like to change or add
2. Indicate on the issue whether you are going to provide the fix or addition yourself
3. Submit the issue for approval by Dysel
4. If your issue is approved and you have elected to provide the fix, you can submit a pull request with the fix for review
5. Await the review and resolve any comments by the reviewers

> If you do not elect to provide the fix and your issue is approved, it will go on our backlog.  
> In that case, there will be no guarantee if or when it will be picked up by our documentation team

### Contribution best practice
Dysel uses the page scripting tool built into the Business Central web client to create and store scenarios. We then use [CentralQ Chat](https://katson.com/apps/centralq-chat/) by Dimitry Katson to create work instructions and export them as MarkDown (.md) files. These MD files form the basis of the documentation website. This is a quick, easy, and reusable method of easily creating work instructions.


### Review other submissions
In addition to creating content, you can also help us by helping us by [reviewing outstanding pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). We can all use an extra pair of eyes sometimes.
