# Service Planning
A key aspect of service is planning. Using service actions, you can set up a schedule based on dates, operating hours, or a combination of both. Based on the settings you provide, Dysel BC can calculate the expected dates that service is due. This section will walk you through the setup and calculation of the service action planning, as well as the creation of work orders based on that planning.
